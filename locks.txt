StampedLock is a major improvement over existing lock implementations especially with increasing numbers of reader threads.
StampedLock has a complex API. It is very easy to mistakenly call the wrong method for locking actions.
Synchronised is a good general purpose lock implementation when contention is from only 2 threads.
ReentrantLock is a good general purpose lock implementation when thread counts grow as previously discovered.
Choosing to use ReentrantReadWriteLock should be based on careful and appropriate measurement. As with all major decisions, measure and make decisions based on data.
Lock-free implementations can offer significant throughput advantages over lock-based algorithms.
